                                    In Spring 2016, construction of the HATPI building at Las Campanas Observatory was
                                    nearly completed.
                                    The concrete pier for the equatorial mount had been poured and aligned.
                                    Plans were in place to install interior electrical components, power, HVAC, and
                                    internet
                                    connectivity.
                                    The facility consisted of two parts: a large instrument bay with a roll-off roof to
                                    house the HATPI instrument
                                    and allow for maintenance, and a shed containing a server room with computers to
                                    operate
                                    the telescope mount,
                                    acquire and analyze image frames, and store data. The shed also featured a small
                                    "observer's lounge"
                                    for maintenance personnel. Although HATPI was intended to operate autonomously,
                                    having on-site facilities for emergencies was considered useful.

                                    In Summer 2016, the engineering design of the HATPI mount and instrument holder
                                    units
                                    was finalized.
                                    The plan was to use 63 lenses attached to low-profile back-illuminated CCD cameras,
                                    controlled by
                                    focus and fine-pointing actuators. The mount was designed as a stepped pyramid to
                                    allow
                                    easy access
                                    for maintenance personnel from above and below, coupled with a heavy-duty equatorial

                                    of handling several tons of moving instrument weight.

            <h1>Key Science</h1>
            <p>
              The HATPI project focuses on exploring the dynamic universe, observing phenomena such as transiting exoplanets, supernovae, variable stars, and near-Earth asteroids.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Transiting Exoplanets</h2>
	    <p>
	      By continuously monitoring a quarter of the full celestial sphere all night, every night, at high cadence, spatial resolution, and photometric precision, HATPI will be able to detect a large number of exoplanetary transit events. HATPI is an especially powerful tool for finding the infrequent transits of long period, cold Jupiters that can take years or more to orbit their stars.  
	    </p>
	    <h2>Transient Events</h2>
	    <p>
	      The high cadence and ultra-wide field-of-view of HATPI give it a unique sensitivity to fast astronomical transient events that may be missed by other time-domain surveys that observe the full sky at a much lower cadence. HATPI is expected to observe many bright transients, like nearby supernovae, Galactic novae, or kilonovae, providing valuable observations during the rise time before they are detected by other surveys.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Variable Stars</h2>
	    <p>
	      HATPI will produce long-term, high-cadence light curves for 10s of millions of stars, enabling the study of hundreds of thousands of variable stars. HATPI will be especially useful for detecting very long period stellar eclipsing binary systems, for routinely measuring the rotation periods of a vast number of sun-like stars, for detecting stellar flares, for studying stellar activity cycles, and for studying long-term mode changes in pulsating stars.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Moving Objects</h2>
	    <p>
              HATPI will observe 1000s of Near-Earth asteroids every year, and will be particularly sensitive to very small nearby asteroids that would otherwise go undetected. It will also be useful for providing light curves of asteroids that can be used to measure their rotation periods and characterize their shapes.
